      # The core methods that most analytics services implement are listed below.
      # Modules will ignore any calls that they don't respond to, allowing them to
      # only partially implement this basic template (or implement their own arbitrary custom methods)
      #

      # This is used to record page-view events, where you want to pass a URL to an analytics service
      # def track(*args)

      # Identify provides a unique identifier to an analytics service to keep track of the current user
      # id should be a unique string (depending on which service you use), and some services also
      # make use of a data hash as a second parameters, containing :email=>'test@test.com', for instance
      # def identify(id, *args)

      # Event is meant to track important funnel conversions in your app, or other important events
      # that you want to inform a funnel analytics service about.  You can pass optional data to this method as well.
      # def event(name, *args)

      # Set passes some data to the analytics service that should be attached to the current user identity
      # It can be used to set AB-testing choices and other unique data, so that split testing results can be
      # reported by an analytics service
      # def set(data)

      # This method generates the initialization javascript that an analytics service uses to track your site
      # def init_javascript(location)
